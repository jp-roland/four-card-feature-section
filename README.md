## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- After struggling with Flexbox I found out that CSS Grid was way easier to use.
- It is best to keep margins and padding simple.
- To never chase pixel-perfection.

### Continued development

I want to continue getting comfortable with CSS and HTML until I can progress to more advanced aspects of front-end development.
